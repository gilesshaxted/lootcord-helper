--- LOOTCORD GAME KNOWLEDGE BASE (VERSION 6.0 - MAX CONTEXT) ---

// This database contains comprehensive facts about the game. Use this information to answer user questions accurately.

// I. CORE MECHANICS & PLAYER STATUS
- Primary Currency: Scrap (SC). The emoji for this is <:scrap:1297320884255588362>.
- Skills: Strength (Multiplies melee/range damage), Luck (Affects loot quality/chances).
- XP/Level Up: Gain XP from opening boxes, crafting, or killing players. Check progress with 't-xp'. Leveling up unlocks new crafting recipes and grants a level-based crate.
- Death Consequence: Lose 75% of scrap and 2 or more items when killed by another player.
- Player Inactivity: A player inactive for > 2 weeks is automatically deactivated from all servers to keep the attack pool active.
- Prefix Change: Change the bot's prefix using 't-setprefix [new prefix]' (requires Manage Server permission).

// II. COMBAT, SHIELDS & STATUS EFFECTS
- DAMAGE CALCULATION: (Base Damage * Strength Skill Multiplier * Bleeding Multiplier).
- Bleeding Status: Grants a 50% (1.5x) extra damage buff if active.
- Passive Shield: Grants a 24-hour attack shield upon death. Removed instantly if the player attacks someone.
- Attack Mode: Servers can be set to 'Random' (forced via t-serversettings) or 'Selectable' (allows targeting players via 't-use [weapon] @player').

// III. INVENTORY & ITEM MANAGEMENT
- Inventory Check: Use 't-inv' (views items, health, money, and equipped storage container).
- Inventory Space: Limited. Use 't-equip storage container' to increase inventory capacity.
- Item Usage: Use 't-use [item]'. 't-use crate' opens boxes.
- Black Market: List and search items for sale by other players using the 't-blackmarket' command.

// IV. CRAFTING & RECYCLING
- Crafting Command: Use 't-craft [item]' to create gear.
- Crafting Skill: Crafting requires a separate Crafting Skill. Higher skill levels unlock better recipes.
- Recycling Command: Use 't-recycle [item]' to dismantle items.
- Recycling Yield: Turns unwanted items back into basic resources (e.g., Metal Fragments, Cloth). Example: Recycling 'Sheet Metal' yields 'Metal Fragments'.

// V. CLAN MECHANICS (DETAILED)

- Clan Creation: Cost is 10,000 scrap. Use 't-clan create [name]'.
- Clan Storage: Deposit/Withdraw using 't-clan deposit/withdraw [item/scrap] [amount]'. 't-clan deposit all' works.
- Daily Upkeep: Automatically paid from scrap bank. Missing upkeep results in a random item loss from storage daily.
- Clan Repair: Use 't-clan repair [material]' to heal base HP. Clans passively gain 5 HP every 2 hours.
